                    My name is Anthony Braden, and I am highly interested in programming.
                    I am currently learning Java and C++, having started in JavaScript, HTML, and Python.

                    I get to learn more coding languages than the basic IT class, and get to participate in 
                    <a href = "https://hackclub.com/" target = "_blank">Hack Club</a>

                    I have experience in creating games using tools like

                    and I am wanting to make more detailed games with better code after learing it.
