                My name is Anthony Braden, and I am highly interested in programming.
                I learned Java, JavaScript, HTML, and Python, and I'm trying to learn C++.
                In my final year of High School in Senior year, I am taking the Capstone class
                of my IT Academy where I will be coding a game for the whole year. I will be posting more in
                the future as I progress.

                I have accomplished many different things in life.
                One of the biggest things I have achieved is getting the Eagle Rank in Boy Scouts.
                I have worked hard to get this and have learned a lot along the way.
                By the time of getting Eagle Rank, I had aquired 55 Merit Badges,
                which gave me 6 Eagle Palms.
            </p>

                I have played many roles in many different sports.
                The sports I have played are, Baseball, Football, Flag Football, Swimming, and Basketball.
                Basketball is the sport I have made most in life as I have played it for 6 years.
                I have also done some other less competitive sports.
                The sports that I have done are some golf and disk golf.
