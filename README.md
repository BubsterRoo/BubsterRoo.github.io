This is a portfolio about me for my School's coding club.
It will be posted on the Barracoders website for our coders portfolios.
This tells about me and what I am interested in.

There are a couple links throughout the portfolio to direct you to
my own social media and to other websites I participate in.

There will be other updates in the future to add more to it like my projects I have made,
which will be done after HighSeas for Hackclub, and more that comes to my mind.

This is also compatible for Mobile.
